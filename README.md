Fully inspired by the project: https://github.com/NeuralNine/vidstream
I just wanted to improve on it and add more features. I am still not done.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/HamzLDN/RemoteDesktop.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## IMPORTANT!
Please i do not support any type of malicious activities with my code please use it at your own risk.  
## Updates
I have now added the feature where you can control the client with a switch.
Now you can see the clients mouse mouse when they are streaming.

## Next update
- End to end encryption
