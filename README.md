# RemoteDesktop
Remote desktop application still in development

Fully inspired by the project: https://github.com/NeuralNine/vidstream
I just wanted to improve on it and add more flexibility. I am still not done.
I want to add some compression to speed up the data and possibly fix some minor bugs.
