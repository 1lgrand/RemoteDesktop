# RemoteDesktop
Remote desktop application still in development

Fully inspired by the project: https://github.com/NeuralNine/vidstream
I just wanted to improve on it and add more features. I am still not done.
## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/HamzLDN/RemoteDesktop.git
cd RemoteDesktop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Updates
I have now added compression using the lzma library and i have improved the refresh rate and it runs smoother.
I have also improved the mouse response time.

# Next update
- End to end encryption
- Add an option to turn off mouse and keyboard control

I would appreciate a star :)
