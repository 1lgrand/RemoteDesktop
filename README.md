# RemoteDesktop
Remote desktop application still in development

Fully inspired by the project: https://github.com/NeuralNine/vidstream
I just wanted to improve on it and add more features. I am still not done.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/HamzLDN/RemoteDesktop.git
cd RemoteDesktop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Updates
I have now added the feature where you can control the client with a switch.

## Next update
- End to end encryption
